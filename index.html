        Hi, I'm Yuqi Cheng.
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I am an M.S Data student at Columbia Journalism School, expected to graduate in Aug 2024. I am interested in the
        Sci & Tech beat, building tools, or introducing AI for local newsrooms. I have interned at Scientific American
        and
        South Metropolis Daily in China, also freelanced in opinion writing at People's Daily and etc. I received the
        Fan-Jingyi Journalism Award in 2022 as a physics
        undergraduate student at Tsinghua University. Before that I was trying to figure out ultrafast laser
        spectroscopy and 2D materials.

              <p>Fireworks are prohibited in New York City. I looked into the 311 firework complaint data and found that the complaint around 2024 Lunar New Year has a sudden jump, while the number of firework complaints on July 4 - the only unrivaled peak every year - has a decreasing trend. The complaints were mostly around Sunset Park in Brooklyn, a community where many Chinese immigrants live.</p>

              <p>A new kind of kumquat swipes the fruit market in Flushing this year. Unlike the regular types, they are egg-sized, honey-sweet, and of course, expensive. I went to a supermarket to copy the fruit prices, compare its sweetness with other fruits, and show how Rong'an County, the origin of this kumquat in China, handle the different varieties.</p>

              <p>Crime around shelters is by no means a new concern raised by shelter opponents. In the context of the
                migrant crisis in New York, the NYPD crime data is examined around two shelters: the Roosevelt Hotel in
                Manhattan, and the Sunset Park Recreation Center in Brooklyn. Even as residents raised concerns at local
                public safety meetings, the number shows no significant change in crime rates two blocks away.

              <p>Oppenheimer is a nuclear-related film released in last summer. A month later, however, another
                real-life nuclear-related incident did not seem to get as much attention in the U.S. media. On August
                24, 2023, the Japanese government started discharging treated Fukushima nuclear wastewater into the ocean.
                Media analysis shows strong contrast between the American media and the media in East Asia - they all
                relatively neglected the other.</p>
